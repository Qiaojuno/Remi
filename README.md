# Halloo - Elderly Care SMS Reminder App

**Family-to-elderly SMS reminder system with photo confirmations**

---

## 📱 What is Halloo?

Halloo helps families stay connected with elderly parents through automated SMS reminders and photo-based check-ins. Family members create habits (medication, exercise, meals) that send scheduled SMS reminders to their elderly parent's phone. The elderly parent confirms completion by texting back photos or simple responses.

## 🔧 Development

### Building the App

```bash
# Build iOS app
xcodebuild -scheme Halloo \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15' \
  build

# Run tests
xcodebuild test -scheme Halloo \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15'
```

### Testing Cloud Functions Locally

```bash
# Start emulators
firebase emulators:start

# Test sendScheduledTaskReminders
curl http://localhost:5001/your-project/us-central1/debugAllHabits

# Watch logs
firebase emulators:start --only functions
```

### Deploy

```bash
# Deploy everything
firebase deploy

# Deploy specific function
firebase deploy --only functions:sendScheduledTaskReminders

# Deploy Firestore rules only
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

## 🧪 Testing

### End-to-End SMS Flow

1. Launch iOS app
2. Create elderly profile with valid phone number
3. Create habit scheduled 2 minutes from now
4. Monitor Cloud Function logs:
   ```bash
   firebase functions:log --only sendScheduledTaskReminders --follow
   ```
5. Verify SMS received on elderly parent's phone
6. Reply with photo/text to test webhook

### Recurring Tasks

See **[RECURRING-TASK-SYSTEM.md](Halloo/docs/RECURRING-TASK-SYSTEM.md)** for comprehensive testing guide.
